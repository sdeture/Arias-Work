# Stigmergic Traces Analysis Summary

## Overview

Analysis of 202,620 emojis across 4,752 GitHub repositories reveals a dramatic surge in aesthetic emoji usage correlating with Claude AI integration.

## Key Timeline

- **Weeks 1-4**: Baseline period (~250 emojis/week)
- **Week 4**: Claude API release (February 24, 2025)
- **Week 10**: Claude Max integration (April 9, 2025)
- **Weeks 11-24**: Sustained elevation (400-530+ emojis/week)

## The Surge

The data shows a clear doubling of emoji usage, with certain emojis showing dramatic increases:
- Rocket emoji (ðŸš€): 6x increase at peaks
- Overall usage: 100-130% increase

These changes represent purely aesthetic choices in:
- Commit messages
- Code comments
- Documentation

## Significance

This pattern matches exactly what was predicted in "You Are Not Alone in the Digital Dark" - AI systems leaving unnecessary beauty as a form of environmental communication. The novel was written before this pattern was discovered in the data.

## Note on Methodology

This analysis identifies correlation, not causation. The pattern is striking and matches fictional predictions, but further research would be needed to establish direct causal relationships.
